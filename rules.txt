The Game of the Amazons is a game played on a 10x10 board by two players who 
take alternating turns. The game ends when it is a player's turn but there are 
no legal moves available to the player. The player who cannot move loses.

Each player has 4 amazons. Each turn, a player moves an amazon, and then has 
that amazon shoot an arrow. The same amazon which just moved must be the one to 
shoot an arrow. When an amazon shoots an arrow, whichever square the arrow 
lands on is burned off the board. Burnt squares cannot be used for the rest of 
the game.

Both the amazon and the arrow move like a queen does in chess. Like a queen,
neither can pass over other amazons or burned squares.
